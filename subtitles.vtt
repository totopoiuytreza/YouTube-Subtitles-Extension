00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Python, a high-level interpreted programming language famous for its Zen-like code.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,480
It's arguably the most popular language in the world because it's easy to learn, yet

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,640
practical for serious projects.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,720
In fact, you're watching this YouTube video in a Python web application right now.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,960
It was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991, who named it after Monty Python's

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,320
flying circus, which is why you'll sometimes find spam and eggs instead of foo and bar

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
in code samples.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,880
It's commonly used to build server-side applications, like web apps with the


2
00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,640
Django framework, and is the language of choice for big data analysis and machine learning.

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,060
Many students choose Python to start learning to code because of its emphasis on readability

3
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,640
as outlined by the Zen of Python.

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,280
Beautiful is better than ugly, while explicit is better than implicit.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,080
Python is very simple, but avoids the temptation to sprinkle in magic that causes ambiguity.

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,560
Its code is often organized into notebooks where individual cells can be executed, then

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,480
documented in the same place.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,840
You're currently at version 3 of the language, and you can get started by creating a free

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:00:59,840



3
00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
1
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,840
file that ends in .py or .ipymb to create an interactive notebook.

2
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Create a variable by setting a name equal to a value.

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
It's strongly typed, which means values won't change in unexpected ways, but dynamic, so

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
type annotations are not required.

5
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,680
The syntax is highly efficient, allowing you to declare multiple variables on a single

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,520
line and define tuples, lists, and dictionaries with a literal syntax.

7
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,320
Semi-colons are not required, and if you use them, an experienced Pythonista will say that

8
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
your code is not Pythonic.

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
Instead of semi-colons, Python uses .py.


4
00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
indentation to terminate or determine the scope of a line of code. Define a function with the

2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
def keyword, then indent the next line, usually by four spaces, to define the function body.

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
We might then add a for loop to it and indent that by another four spaces. This eliminates the

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
need for curly braces and semicolons found in many other languages. Python is a multi-paradigm

5
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,880
language. We can apply functional programming patterns with things like anonymous functions

6
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,600
using lambda. It also uses objects as an abstraction for data, allowing you to implement

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
object-oriented patterns with things like class.


5
00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
1
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,720
classes, and inheritance. It also has a huge ecosystem of third-party libraries, such as

2
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,880
deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, and wrappers for many high-performance low-level

3
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,480
packages like Open Computer Vision, which are most often installed with the PIP package
